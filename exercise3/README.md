# Exercise 2: Users

Starting with the code in /exercise2, add a RESTful API on the endpoint /users
that allows listing, creating and editing of a user.

## Things to note:

* ``XTilDone\Users\MapperInterface`` is useful
* Inject ``XTilDone\Users\TableGatewayMapper`` via a ``UserResourceFactory`` class
