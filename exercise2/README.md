# Exercise 2: Users

Starting with the code in /exercise2, add a RESTful API on the endpoint /users
that allows listing all users, viewing a single one and creating a user.

## Things to note:

* Inject ``XTilDone\Users\TableGatewayMapper`` into the ``UserResource`` class
  (via local factory classes & the ``UserResourceFactory``)
* Helpful code in ``exercise2/_exercise_files``
