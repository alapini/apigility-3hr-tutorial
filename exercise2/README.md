# Exercise 2: Books service

Starting with the code in /exercise2, add a RESTful API on the endpoint /books
that lists all the books.

## Things to note:

* Inject `XTilDone\Lists\TableGatewayMapper` into the `ListsResource` class
  (via local factory classes & the `ListsResourceFactory`)
* Helpful code in `exercise2/_exercise_files`
